# fslog

This is a playground for experimenting with file system monitoring APIs. The motivation and plan for fslog is outlined in [Event logger for research](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/23).

The cmd tools log raw events to better understand and compare the behaviour of each API. 

This insight, and possibly some code, will make its way back into [fsnotify](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify).
